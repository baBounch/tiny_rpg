# Tiny RPG
An WIP RPG written in rust using sdl2. It is currently very bare bones,
but will soon have a lot more features.

Not read to play and will not use semantic versioning in alpha since
things will change a lot. alpha will be 0.1.* where * is the current release
version.

Since a lot is changing fast, a lot of the documentation includes future plans and notes about things likely to change.

## Currently Planned Features
- Absolutely invincible and destructable walls.
- Entities that are fixed to the screen (even ui will be entities)
- Combat with Entities
- The user will have an abilities, abilities toggle and interations toggle buttons.
- Players will be able to cast abilities they have or move into things with a toggled interation to use.
- Dialog with Entities
- Menu settings that are done with player movement.
- Far better ai
- A small campain
- Possibly a scripting language for others to make levels and games easily.
- Split game and engine, so people can more easily use the engine for their own games.
